# Usage:
#
#  1. Compile the program into the intermediate representation (IR):
#
#     python fit_a_line.py
#
#  2. Interpret and run the IR:
#
#     python fit_a_line.py | fluid
#
#     where fluid is the Fluid interpreter, a C++ program.
#
from fluid.program import tensor

W = tensor([1.0])

# with fluid.loop(steps=100):
#     x, y = fluid.data()
#     cost = fluid.mse(fluid.fc(x, W), y)
#     fluid.optimize(cost)

# fluid.print(W)
