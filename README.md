# `fluid`

The [official PaddlePaddle implementation](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/tree/develop/paddle/fluid) looks somehow deviated from [my original design](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/blob/develop/doc/fluid/design/motivation/fluid.md).  When I review the lessons I learned from this project, I feel that we should have a minimum-viable-product (MVP) first to demo the design purpose and to help contributors better understand the design before they start coding.  Thereforce, I am working on this experimental, simplified re-implementation of PaddlePaddle Fluid.
